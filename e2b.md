## Secure code execution with E2B

You can run the output generated by Mistral's LLMs in the E2B secure sandbox environment.

To build with E2B and Mistral's models, check out the examples in Mistral Cookbook. You can choose from a [Python](LINK_HERE) or [JavaScript/TypeScript](LINK_HERE) version.

### What is E2B?

E2B provides an isolated sandbox environment for AI apps. It is the code interpreting layer where the LLM-generated code is executed. The E2B SDK has a Python and JavaScript/TypeScript version. It works with any LLM and all AI frameworks (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen...)


### Starting with Code Interpreter SDK
The Code Interpreter SDK is E2B's special SDK that is tailor-made for AI data analysts, coding apps, and reasoning-heavy agents.

To start get your E2B API key [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key) for free. To get familiar with the SDK, check out the [E2B docs](https://e2b.dev/docs) or [E2B Cookbook](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook).  If you need support [hello@e2b.dev](mailto:hello@e2b.dev).
